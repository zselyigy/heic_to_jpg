# HEIC to JPG Converter

This program provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to convert HEIC/HEIF files to JPG format. It allows users to convert single files, multiple files, or entire directories. Additionally, it supports options such as recursive conversion in subdirectories, deletion of processed HEIC files, and zipping of processed files.

## Installation and Setup:
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Install required dependencies:
  - customtkinter: pip install customtkinter
- The `heif-convert.exe` executable is required for conversion. Ensure it is placed in the appropriate location as per the code.

## Usage:
- Run the script. This will open a GUI window.
- Select either a single HEIC file, multiple HEIC files, or a directory containing HEIC files.
- Configure conversion options such as quality, recursive conversion, deletion of processed files, zipping of processed files, and appearance mode (dark or light).
- Click the "Convert files/directory" button to initiate the conversion process.
- Conversion progress and status will be displayed in the GUI.
- Close the application window when done.
